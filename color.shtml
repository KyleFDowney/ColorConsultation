        <h2>Picking Paint Colors doesn’t have to be Overwhelming</h2>

        <p>
          With over 25 years of experience in home interior paint color
          consulting, I’m now offering my paint consultant services online at a
          fraction of the cost for an in-home consultation.
        </p>

        <h3>How my Online Paint Consultant Service Works</h3>

        <p>
          After you’ve chosen the Paint Color Package LINK TO TAB that fits your
          painting project, click on the Shop tab at top to purchase the
          package.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon processing of your payment, you will receive an email with an
          attached questionnaire. If you don’t receive the email, please check
          your spam folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to provide you with the best color options to fit your
          project, please complete and return the questionnaire along with a few
          photos which will help me choose the colors that will work best in
          your home. Within 48 hours of receipt of the completed questionnaire
          and photos, you will receive an email which will contain 3 paint color
          options for you to choose your preference, but each paint color
          provided will work beautifully in your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are helpful tips to consider before choosing the Paint Color
          Package that fits your needs:
        </p>
        <h2>Where to Start when Choosing a Paint Color</h2>

        <h3>Are you looking to make your room appear more spacious?</h3>
        <h3>
          Do you want the room to resonate a warm feeling or create a bold
          statement?
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Are you looking for an elegant neutral or a neutral shade of color?
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Neutral colors work well with a wide array of colors to accessorize.
        </h3>

        <h2>Accent Walls</h2>
        <p>
          Accent walls were more popular in the 90’s with my customers, but a
          beautiful accent wall can really work in certain rooms.
        </p>

        <h2>Color Elimination</h2>

        <div class="alignTextMid">
          <h3>Don't let an undertone</h3>
          <img src="./img/color3.png" class="alignTextMid" />
          <h3>undermind your vision</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          Just as the same color paint may look completely different in your
          home from your friend’s home due to lighting, accessories, trim and
          flooring. Paint colors can even vary from room to room in your own
          home.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is due to the paint having warmer or cooler undertones and how
          these undertones interact with the undertones of your furniture,
          accessories, flooring and room lighting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although you might have already eliminated a particular paint color as
          you didn’t feel it worked in your home, it could be possible the same
          color with different undertones could work.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an example, a gray paint can have undertones of blue, green or
          purple. If one shade of gray doesn’t fit well in your room, it is
          quite possible another shade of gray with different undertones could
          look beautiful in your room.
